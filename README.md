# rusted-chip8

Simple Chip-8 Emulator written in rust

This was just my introduction project into the world of emulation. I basically just followed the [Chip8-Book](https://github.com/aquova/chip8-book) so there is next to none of my input.

## Usage

To load rom just drag and drop the file on the window.

### Run

>      $ cargo run

### Build For Release

>      $ cargo build --release
